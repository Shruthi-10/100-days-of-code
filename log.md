### Day 5: April 21 2024, Sunday

**Today's Progress** Worked with functions in javaScript. Started with a skillcrush project. Started a personal project to build a minimal todo list.          

**Thoughts** I need a lot more practise with javaScript. I am enjoying javaScript the most. It can do so much. I hope it gets easier soon, because I am struggling to understand even when I look at the solution code. Functions, variables, scope, parameters everything is a mess in my head at the moment.

### Day 11: April 27 2024, Saturday

**Today's Progress** Halfway into building a piano using html and css

**Thoughts** Freecodecamp projects are very hands on and introduce me to so many new elements than what I learn in Skillcrush. Goodway to supplement my learning.

### Day 12: April 28 2024, Sunday

**Today's Progress** Worked on a Skillcrush's javaScript project to build an expense tracker that can find out what the minimum and maximum expense is. 

**Thoughts** Trying to read out all coding projects in my mind and trying to explain it to myself. It seems to be helping? Because I seem to understand a little more.
