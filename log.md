**Today's Progress** Worked with eventListerners and a few other new stuff on JavaScript

### Day 5: April 21 2024, Sunday

**Today's Progress** Worked with functions in javaScript. Started with a skillcrush project. Started a personal project to build a minimal todo list.          

**Thoughts** I need a lot more practise with javaScript. I am enjoying javaScript the most. It can do so much. I hope it gets easier soon, because I am struggling to understand even when I look at the solution code. Functions, variables, scope, parameters everything is a mess in my head at the moment.
